   ABSTRACT   = {There are diﬀerent possibilities to deﬁne implications in a triadic formal context. We discuss several such notions. Our main interest is to give compact descriptions and to use them for an algorithm that generates these implications. Our ﬁndings are illustrated by a small example.},

   ABSTRACT   = {Recent progress towards unifying the probabilistic and preferential models semantics for non-monotonic reasoning has led to a remarkable observation: Any consistent system of default rules imposes an unambiguous and natural ordering on these rules which, to emphasize its simple and basic character, we term "Z-ordering." This ordering can be used with various levels of refinement, to prioritize conflicting arguments, to rank the degree of abnormality of states of the world, and to define plausible consequence relationships. This paper defines the Z-ordering, briefly mentions its semantical origins, and illustrates two simple entailment relationships induced by the ordering. Two extensions are then described, maximum-entropy and conditional entailment, which trade in computational simplicity for semantic refinements.},

   ABSTRACT   = {Many systems that exhibit nonmonotonic behavior have been described and studied already in the literature. The general notion of nonmonotonic reasoning, though, has almost always been described only negatively, by the property it does not enjoy, i.e. monotonicity. We study here general patterns of nonmonotonic reasoning and try to isolate properties that could help us map the ﬁeld of nonmonotonic reasoning by reference to positive properties. We concentrate on a number of families of nonmonotonic consequence relations, deﬁned in the style of Gentzen [13]. Both proof-theoretic and semantic points of view are developed in parallel. The former point of view was pioneered by D. Gabbay in [10], while the latter has been advocated by Y. Shoham in [38]. Five such families are deﬁned and characterized by representation theorems, relating the two points of view. One of the families of interest, that of preferential relations, turns out to have been studied by E. Adams in [2]. The preferential models proposed here are a much stronger tool than Adams’ probabilistic semantics. The basic language used in this paper is that of propositional logic. The extension of our results to ﬁrst order predicate calculi and the study of the computational complexity of the decision problems described in this paper will be treated in another paper.},
